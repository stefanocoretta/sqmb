## Summary from last time

---

.bg-washed-blue.b--dark-blue.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt2[
**(1)** What is a **factorial design?**
- A design with multiple predictors in which data is gathered for **every combination** of those predictors' levels.
]

.bg-washed-blue.b--dark-blue.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt2[
**(2)** How do we estimate and interpret the effects of **multiple predictors?**
- A predictor's $\beta$ is the effect of that predictor *when the other predictor's value is 0*.
]

.bg-washed-blue.b--dark-blue.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt2[
**(3)** How do we deal with situations when **one predictor's effect is different, depending on the value of the other predictor?**
- We fit a model that contains an **interaction term** between those two predictors.
]

---

.bg-washed-blue.b--dark-blue.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt2[
**(4)** How can such interactions between predictors be **built into our models?**
- The interaction term is defined as the **product** of the two interacting predictors.
- It gets its own $\beta$ coefficient, which we estimate as usual.
]

.bg-washed-blue.b--dark-blue.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt2[
**(5)** How do we **interpret model estimates** of interactions? 
- The interaction term's $\beta$ tells us **how much one predictor's effect changes between the baseline and non-baseline levels of the other**.
- Interactions are symmetrical, and so they have two equivalent interpretations.

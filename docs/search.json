Run the following in the Console.\ninstall.packages(\"remotes\")\nremotes::install_github(\"stan-dev/cmdstanr\")\ninstall.packages(c(\"brms\"))\ninstall.packages(c(\"tidybayes\", \"extraDistr\"))\nThe cmdstanr package is an interface between R and CmdStan (see below), while brms is the package you will use to run Bayesian linear models (think of it as the Bayesian equivalent of lme4).\nIt will take several minutes to install the packages, depending on your system and configuration.\nIf at any point you get asked about installing extra packages or software or update existing packages or software, please do so. In all cases, carefully read the message in the Console or in a pop-up window: they always tell you what to do or the options you have.\n\n\nInstall CmdStan\nNow that you have installed the R packages, you need to install CmdStan.\nCmdStan is a shell interface to the programming language Stan.\nStan is what runs the Bayesian models, but you don’t have to know Stan, because you will use the R packages to run the models (those packages will communicate with Stan in your stead).\nTo install CmdStan, run the following command in the R console:\ncmdstanr::install_cmdstan(cores = parallel::detectCores(), overwrite = TRUE)\nIt will take several minutes and you will see a lot of text flashing in the Console."

Think of this as the interface to R.\nThe Environment tab lists the objects created with R, while in the Files tab you can navigate folders on your computer to get to files and open them in the file Editor.\n\nRStudio projects\nRStudio is an IDE (see above) which allows you to work efficiently with R, all in one place.\nNote that files and data live in folders on your computer, outside of RStudio: do not think of RStudio as an app where you can save files in.\nAll the files that you see in the Files tab are files on your computer and you can access them from the Finder or File Explorer as you would with any other file.\nIn principle, you can open RStudio and then navigate to any folder or file on your computer.\nHowever, there is a more efficient way of working with RStudio: RStudio Projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRStudio Projects\n\n\n\nAn RStudio Project is a folder on your computer that has an .Rproj file.\n\n\nYou can create as many RStudio Projects as you wish, and I recommend to create one per project (your dissertation, a research project, etc…).\nWe will create an RStudio Project for this course. You will be using this Project throughout the semester.\nTo create an RStudio Project, click on the button that looks like a transparent light blue box with a plus, in the top-left corner of RStudio.

You should see that the answer to the addition has been printed in the Console, like this:\n[1] 3\nNow, try some more operations (write each of the following in the Console and press ENTER). Feel free to add your own to the mix!\n\n67 - 13\n2 * 4\n268 / 43\n\nYou can also chain multiple operations.\n\n6 + 4 - 1 + 2\n4 * 2 + 3 * 2\n\n\n\nVariables\n\nForget-me-not.\n\nMost times, we want to store a certain value so that we can use it again later.\nWe can achieve this by creating variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\n\n\n\nA variable holds one or more values and it’s stored in the computer memory for later use.\n\n\nYou can create a variable by using the assignment operator <-.\nLet’s assign the value 156 to the variable my_num.\n\nmy_num <- 156\n\nNow, check the list of variables in the Environment tab of the top-right panel of RStudio. You should see the my_num variable and its value there.\nNow, you can just call the variable back when you need it! Write the following in the Console and press ENTER.\n\nmy_num\n\n[1] 156\n\n\nA variable like my_num is also called a numeric vector: i.e. a vector that contains a number (hence numeric).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVector\n\n\n\nA vector is an R object that contains one or more values of the same type.\n\n\nLet’s now try some operations using variables.\n\nincome <- 1200\nexpenses <- 500\nincome - expenses\n\n[1] 700\n\n\nSee? You can use operations with variables too!\nAnd you can also go all the way with variables.\n\nsavings <- income - expenses\n\nAnd check the value…\n\nsavings\n\n[1] 700\n\n\nVectors can hold more than one item or value.\nJust use the combine c() function to create a vector containing multiple values.\nThe following are all numeric vectors.\n\none_i <- 6\n# Vector with 2 values\ntwo_i <- c(6, 8)\n# Vector with 3 values\nthree_i <- c(6, 8, 42)\n\nCheck the list of variables in the Environment tab. You will see now that before the values of two_i and three_i you get the vector type num for numeric. (If the vector has only one value, you don’t see the type in the Enviroment list but it is still of a particular type).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumeric vector\n\n\n\nA numeric vector is a vector that holds one or more numeric values.\n\n\nNote that the following are the same:\n\none_i <- 6\none_i\n\n[1] 6\n\none_ii <- c(6)\none_ii\n\n[1] 6\n\n\n\n\nFunctions\n\nR cannot function without… functions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunction\n\n\n\nA function is an operation performed on one or more arguments.\n\n\nA function in R has the form function() where:\n\nfunction is the name of the function, like sum.\n() are round parentheses, inside of which you write arguments, separated by commas.\n\nLet’s see an example:\n\nsum(3, 5)\n\n[1] 8\n\n\nThe sum() function sums the number listed as arguments. Above, the arguments are 3 and 5.\nAnd of course arguments can be vectors!\n\nmy_nums <- c(3, 5, 7)\n\nsum(my_nums)\n\n[1] 15\n\nmean(my_nums)\n\n[1] 5\n\n\n\n\nString and logical vectors\n\nNot just numbers.\n\nWe have seen that variables can hold numeric vectors. But vectors are not restricted to being numeric. They can also store strings.\nA string is basically a set of characters (a word, a sentence, a full text).\nIn R, strings have to be quoted using double quotes \" \".\nChange the following strings to your name and surname. Remember to keep the double quotes\n\nname <- \"Stefano\"\nsurname <- \"Coretta\"\n\nname\n\n[1] \"Stefano\"\n\n\nStrings can be used as arguments in functions, like numbers can.\n\ncat(\"My name is\", name, surname)\n\nMy name is Stefano Coretta\n\n\nRemember that you can reuse the same variable name to override the variable value.\n\nname <- \"Raj\"\n\ncat(\"My name is\", name, surname)\n\nMy name is Raj Coretta\n\n\nYou can combine multiple strings into a character vector, using c().\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacter vector\n\n\n\nA character vector is a vector that holds one or more strings.\n\n\n\nfruit <- c(\"apple\", \"oranges\", \"bananas\")\nfruit\n\n[1] \"apple\"   \"oranges\" \"bananas\"\n\n\nCheck the Environment tab. Character vectors have chr before the values.\nAnother type of vector is one that contains either TRUE or FALSE. Vectors of this type are called logical vectors and they are listed as logi in the Environment tab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogical vector\n\n\n\nA logical vector is a vector that holds one or more TRUE or FALSE values.\n\n\n\ngroceries <- c(\"apple\", \"flour\", \"margarine\", \"sugar\")\nin_pantry <- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)\n\nTRUE and FALSE values must be written in all capitals and without double quotes (they are not strings!)."

    "text": "In the tutorial last week you’ve been playing around with R and variables.\nBut what if you want to import data in R?\nEasy! You can use the read_csv() function to read a .csv (comma separated value) file. But before we dive in, let’s first talk about some computer basics. (You can skip this section if it’s too basic for you)\n\n\nFiles saved on your computer live in a specific place. For example, if you download a file from a browser (like Google Chrome, Safari or Firefox), the file is normally saved in the Download folder.\nBut where does the Download folder live? Usually, in your user folder! The user folder normally is the name of your account or a name you picked when you created your computer account. In my case, my user folder is simply called ste.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser folder\n\n\n\nThe user folder is the folder with the name of your account.\n\n\nSo, let’s assume I download a file, let’s say big_data.csv, in the Download folder of my user folder.\nNow we can represent the location of the big_data.csv file like so:\nste/\n└── Downloads/\n    └── big_data.csv\nTo mark that ste and Downloads are folders, we add a final forward slash /. That simply means “hey! I am a folder!”. big_data.csv is a file, so it doesn’t have a final /.\nInstead, the file name big_data.csv has a file extension. The file extension is .csv. A file extension marks the type of file: in this the big_data file is a .csv file, a comma separated value file (we will see an example of what that looks like later).\nDifferent file type have different file extensions:\n\nExcel files: .xlsx.\nPlain text files: .txt.\nImages: .png, .jpg, .gif.\nAudio: .mp3, .wav.\nVideo: .mp4, .mov, .avi.\nEtc…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile extension\n\n\n\nA file extension is a sequence of letters that indicates the type of a file and it’s separated with a . from the file name.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, we can use an alternative, more succinct way, to represent the location of the big_data.csv:\nste/Downloads/big_data.csv\nThis is called a file path! It’s the path through folders that lead you to the file. Folders are separated by / and the file is marked with the extension .csv.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile path\n\n\n\nA file path indicates the location of a file on a computer as a path through folders that lead you to the file.\n\n\nNow the million pound question: where does ste/ live on my computer???\nUser folders are located in different places depending on the operating system you are using:\n\nOn macOS: the user folder is in /Users/.\n\nYou will notice that there is a forward slash also before the name of the folder. That is because the /Users/ folder is a top folder, i.e. there are no folders further up in the hierarchy of folders.\nThis means that the full path for the big_data.csv file on a computer running macOS would be: /Users/ste/Downloads/big_data.csv.\n\nOn Windows: the user folder is in C:/Users/\n\nYou will notice that C is followed by a colon :. That is because C is a drive, which contains files and folders. C: is not contained by any other folder, i.e. there are no other folders above C: in the hierarchy of folders.\nThis means that the full path for the big_data.csv file on a Windows computer would be: C:/Users/ste/Downloads/big_data.csv.\n\n\nWhen a file path starts from a top-most folder, we call that path the absolute file path.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbsolute path\n\n\n\nAn absolute path is a file path that starts with a top-most folder.\n\n\nThere is another type of file paths, called relative paths. A relative path is a partial file path, relative to a specific folder. You will learn how to use relative paths below, when we will go through importing files in R using R scripts below.\nImporting files in R is very easy with the tidyverse packages. You just need to know the file type (very often the file extension helps) and the location of the file (i.e. the file path).\nThe next sections will teach you how to import data in R!"

DOI: 10.1017/S0272263120000170.\n\nDownload the data file\nTo download the file with the data right-click on the following link and download the file: shallow.csv. (Note that tutorial files are also linked in the Syllabus)\nCreate a folder in the RStudio project of the course called data and move the downloaded file into that folder.\nI strongly recommend that you keep the course RStudio project folder as organised as possible. The Open Science Framework has the following recommendations that apply very well to any type of research project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganising files\n\n\n\n\nUse one folder per project. This will also be your RStudio project folder.\nSeparate raw data from derived data.\nSeparate code from data.\nMake raw data read-only.\n\n\n\nTo learn more about this, check the OSF page Organising files.\nIn brief, what these recommendations mean is that you want a folder for your research project, and inside the folder two folders: one for data and one for code.\nThe data/ folder could further contain raw/ for raw data (data that should not be lost or changed, for example collected data or annotations) and derived/ for data that derives from the raw data, for example through automated data processing.\nI usually also have a separate folder called figs/ or img/ where I save plots. Of course which folders you will have it’s ultimately up to you and needs will vary depending on the project and field!\nThe rest of the tutorial will assume that you have created a folder called data/ and that shallow.csv is in that folder.\nI recommend you to start being very organised with your files from now, whether it’s for this course or your dissertation or else. I also suggest to avoid overly nested structures (for example, avoid having one folder for each week for this course).\n\n\nAbout shallow.csv\nshallow.csv is a .csv file. It looks like this (the following is just an excerpt from the file, specifically the first 5 lines):\nGroup,ID,List,Target,ACC,RT,logRT,Critical_Filler,Word_Nonword,Relation_type,Branching\nL1,L1_01,A,banoshment,1,423,6.0474,Filler,Nonword,Phonological,NA\nL1,L1_01,A,unawareness,1,603,6.4019,Critical,Word,Unrelated,Left\nL1,L1_01,A,unholiness,1,739,6.6053,Critical,Word,Constituent,Left\nL1,L1_01,A,bictimize,1,510,6.2344,Filler,Nonword,Phonological,NA\nA .csv file is basically a format to save tabular data (i.e. data that looks like a table). To separate each column, a .csv file uses a comma , (hence the name “comma separated values”).\nThe first line of the file indicates the names of the columns of the table:\nGroup,ID,List,Target,ACC,RT,logRT,Critical_Filler,Word_Nonword,Relation_type,Branching\nThere are 11 columns.\nThen, the rest of the file contains the other rows of the table, with values for each of the 11 columns. Of course, separated by commas.\nL1,L1_01,A,banoshment,1,423,6.0474,Filler,Nonword,Phonological,NA\nL1,L1_01,A,unawareness,1,603,6.4019,Critical,Word,Unrelated,Left\nL1,L1_01,A,unholiness,1,739,6.6053,Critical,Word,Constituent,Left\nL1,L1_01,A,bictimize,1,510,6.2344,Filler,Nonword,Phonological,NA\nThe shallow.csv file should be placed in the data/ folder of the course RStudio project.\nNow, let’s import the data!\nImporting .csv files is very easy. You can use the read_csv() function from a collection of R packages known as the tidyverse.\nBut what are R packages? Find out in the following section."

Every time you need to write the code and execute it in the right order and it quickly becomes very difficult to keep track of everything when things start getting more involved.\nA solution is to use R scripts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR script\n\n\n\nAn R script is a file with the .R extension that contains R code.\n\n\nFor the rest of this tutorial, you will write all code in an R script.\n\nCreate an R script\nFirst, create a folder called code in your RStudio project folder. This will be the folder where you will save all of your R scripts.\nNow, to create a new R script, look at the top-left corner of RStudio: the first button to the left looks like a white sheet with a green plus sign. This is the New file button. Click on that and you will see a few options to create a new file.\nClick on R Script. A new empty R script will be created and will open in the File Editor window of RStudio.\n\nNote that creating an R script does not automatically saves it on your computer. To do so, either use the keyboard short-cut CMD+S/CTRL+S or click on the floppy disk icon in the menu below the file tab.\n\nSave the file inside the code/ folder with the following name: tutorial-w02.R.\nRemember that all the files of your RStudio project don’t live inside RStudio but on your computer. So you can always access them from the Finder or File Explorer!\n\n\nWrite code\nNow, let’s start filling up that script!\nGenerally, you start the script with calls to library() to load all the packages you need for the script.\nNow we only need one package, tidyverse, but in most cases you will need more than one! The best practice is to attach all of packages first, in the top of your script. Please, get in the habit of doing this from now, so that you can keep your scripts tidy and pretty!\nGo ahead, write the following code in the top of the tutorial-w02.R script.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nshallow <- read_csv(\"./data/shallow.csv\")\n\nWait, what is that \"./data/shallow.csv\"? That’s a relative path. We briefly mentioned relative paths above, but let’s understand the details now.\n\n\nRelative paths\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nA relative path is a file path that is relative to a folder, which is represented by ./\n\n\nWhen you are using R scripts in RStudio projects, the ./ folder paths are relative to is the project folder! This is true whichever the name of the folder/project and whichever it’s location on your computer.\nFor example, if your project it’s called awesome_proj and it’s in Downloads/stuff/, then if you write ./data/results.csv you really mean Downloads/stuff/awesome_proj/data/results.csv!\nThe code read_csv(\"./data/shallow.csv\") above will work because you are using an RStudio project and inside the project folder there is a folder called data/ and in it there’s the shallow.csv file.\nSo from now on I encourage you to use RStudio projects, R scripts and relative paths always!\nThe benefit of doing so is that, if you move your project or rename it, or if you share the project with somebody, all the paths will just work because they are relative!\n\n\nRun the script!\nFinally, the time has come to run the script.\nThere are several ways of doing this. The most straightforward is to click on the Run button. You can find this in the top-right corner of the script window.\n\nAn alternative way is to place the text cursor on the line of code you want to run and then press CMD+ENTER/CTRL+ENTER. This will run the line of code and move the text cursor to the next line of code.\nYou can even select multiple lines of code (as you would select text) and press CMD+ENTER/CTRL+ENTER to run multiple lines of code!\nNow that you know how to use R scripts and run code in them, I will assume that you will keep writing new code from this tutorial in your script and run it from there!\nJust another tip: sometimes we might want to add a few lines of text in our script, for example to take notes.\nYou can add so-called comments in R scripts, simply by starting a line with #.\nFor example:\n\n# This is a comment. Let's add 6 + 3.\n6 + 3\n\n[1] 9"

    "text": "Data transformation\nData transformation is a fundamental aspect of data analysis.\nAfter the data you need to use is imported into R, you will have to filter rows, create new columns, or join data frames, among many other transformation operations.\nIn this tutorial we will learn how to obtain summary measures and how to count occurrences using the summarise() and count() functions.\n\nSummary measures\nDuring the lecture, we have learnt two types of measures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary measures\n\n\n\nMeasures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) indicate the typical or central value of a sample.\nMeasures of dispersion (standard deviation, range) indicate the dispersion of the sample values around the central tendency value.\n\n\nWhen you work with data, you always want to get summary measures for most of the variables in the data.\nData reports usually include summary measures. It is also important to understand which summary measure is appropriate for which type of variable.\nWe have covered this in the lecture, so we won’t go over it again here. Instead, you will learn how to obtain summary measures using the summarise() function from the dplyr tidyverse package.\nsummarise() takes at least two arguments:\n\nThe data frame to summarise.\nOne or more summary function.\n\nFor example, let’s get the mean the reaction time column RT. Easy!\n\nsummarise(shallow, RT_mean = mean(RT))\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nGreat! The mean reaction times of the entire sample is 867 ms.\nWhat if we want also the standard deviation? Easy!\n\nsummarise(shallow, RT_mean = mean(RT), RT_sd = sd(RT))\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nNow we know that reaction times are on average 867 ms long and have a standard deviation of about 293 ms (rounded to the nearest integer).\nLet’s go all the way and also get the minimum and maximum RT values.\n\nsummarise(\n  shallow,\n  RT_mean = mean(RT), RT_sd = sd(RT),\n  RT_min = min(RT), RT_max = max(RT)\n)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nFab! When writing a data report, you could write something like this.\n\nReaction times are on average 867 ms long (SD = 293 ms), with values ranging from 0 to 1994 ms.\n\nIn some cases, you will want to use the median() instead of the mean(). Note that R has a mode() function, but alas this is not the statistical mode. To get the mode of a categorical variable you can just count the occurrences of the values of that variable and the value that occurs the most is the mode!\n\n\nCount occurrences\nWe can use the count() function from the dplyr tidyverse package to count the number of occurrences for each value of a specific column. Let’s count how many trials are correct, i.e. let’s count occurrences in the ACC column.\nAccuracy has been coded with 0 for incorrect and 1 for correct. We will see how this is not an ideal, although very common way, of coding binary variables. For now let’s keep it as is.\nThe function count() takes the name of tibble and the name of column you want to count values in.\n\ncount(shallow, ACC)\n\nHow many correct responses are there in the shallow tibble?\nNote that you can add multiple column names, separated by commas, to get counts for the combinations of values of each column.\nTry to get counts of the combination of ACC and Group (L1 vs L2 participants). Replace ... with the right code.\n\ncount(shallow, ...)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nIn count(), include the names of the two columns you want to get counts of, separated by commas.\n\n\n\nAre there differences in accuracy between the L1 and L2 group?\n\n\nGrouping data\nSometimes you might want to get summary measures for one variable depending on different values of another variable.\nYou can use the group_by() function from the dplyr tidyverse package, together with summarise() to achieve that. Let’s see how it works.\n\ngroup_by(shallow, Group) %>%\n  summarise(\n    RT_mean = mean(RT),\n    RT_sd = sd(RT)\n  )\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThe group_by() function takes at least two arguments:\n\nThe name of the tibble to group.\nThe name of the columns to group the tibble by, separated by commas.\n\nHere we are grouping shallow by Group.\nIf you are baffled by that %>%, keep on reading.\n\n\nWhat the pipe?!\nWait, what is that thing, %>%?\nIt’s called a pipe. Think of a pipe as a teleporter.\nIn the code above we are chaning two functions together using the pipe opeartor %>%. The output of the first function (group_by()) is “teleported” into the second function summarise().\nThe pipe %>% teleports the output of the preceding function as the first argument of the following function. The output of group_by is a (groupped) tibble, and summarise() needs a tibble as its first argument.\nThat’s why the code above works!\nIn fact, you can even use a pipe for the tibble of group_by(), like so:\n\nshallow %>%\n  group_by(Group) %>%\n    summarise(\n      RT_mean = mean(RT),\n      RT_sd = sd(RT)\n    )\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nYou see that the output of the code is the same here as it is above.\nFor comparison, this is what the code would look like without the pipe.\n\ngrouped_shallow <- group_by(shallow, Group)\n\nsummarise(\n  grouped_shallow,\n  RT_mean = mean(RT),\n  RT_sd = sd(RT)\n)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nDon’t worry too much if the concept of the pipe is not clear yet. It should become clearer later."

    "text": "Rmarkdown\nLast week, you learnt how to use R scripts to save your code.\nKeeping track of the code you use for data analysis is a very important aspect of research project managing: not only the code is there if you need to rerun it later, but it allows your data analysis to be reproducible (i.e., it can be reproduced by you or other people in such a way that starting with the same data and code you get to the same results).\nR scripts are great for writing code, and you can even document the code (add explanations or notes) with comments (i.e. lines that start with #).\nBut for longer text or complex data analysis reports, R scripts can be a bit cumbersome.\nA solution to this is using Rmarkdown files (they have the .Rmd) extension.\n\nCode… and text!\nRmarkdown is a file format that allows you to mix code and formatted text in the same file.\nThis means that you can write dynamic reports using Rmd files: dynamic reports are just like analysis reports (i.e. they include formatted text, plots, tables, code output, code, etc…) but they are dynamic in the sense that if, for example, data or code changes, you can just rerun the report Rmd file and all code output (plots, tables, etc…) are updated accordingly!\nYou can watch this short video for a quick tour.\n\n\n\nFormatting text\nR comments in R scripts cannot be formatted (for example, you can’t make bold or italic texts).\nText in Rmd files can be fully formatted using a simple but powerful mark-up language called markdown.\nYou don’t have to learn markdown all in one go, so I encourage you to just learn it bit by bit, in your time. You can look at the the Markdown Guide for an in-depth intro and/or dive in the Markdown Tutorial for a hands-on approach.\nA few quick pointers (you can test them in the Markdown Live Preview):\n\nText can be made italics by enclosing it between single stars: *this text is in italics*.\nYou can make text bold with two stars: **this text is bold!**.\nHeading are created with #: # This is a level-1 heading. ## This is a level-2 heading.\n\n\n\nCreate an Rmd file\nTo create a new Rmd file, just click on the click on the New file button, then R Markdown.... (If you are asked to install/update packages, do so.)\n\nA window will open. Add a title of your choice and your name, then click OK.\n\nA new Rmd file will be created and will open in the File Editor panel in RStudio.\nNote that creating an Rmd file does not automatically saves it on your computer. To do so, either use the keyboard short-cut CMD+S/CTRL+S or click on the floppy disk icon in the menu below the file tab.\n\nSave the file inside the code/ folder with the following name: tutorial-w03.Rmd.\nRemember that all the files of your RStudio project don’t live inside RStudio but on your computer. So you can always access them from the Finder or File Explorer!\n\n\nParts of an Rmd file\nAn Rmd file usually has three main parts:\n\nThe preamble (green).\nCode chunks (orange).\nText (blue).\n\n\nEach Rmd file has to start with a preamble, but you can include as many code chunks and as much text as you wish, in any order.\n\n\nRender Rmd files to HTML\nYou can render an Rmd file into a nicely formatted HTML file.\nTo render an Rmd file, just click on the Knit button and an HTML file will be created and saved in the same location of the Rmd file.\n\nIt will also be shown in the Viewer pane, in the bottom-right panel of RStudio.\n\nRendering Rmd files is not restricted to HTML, but also PDFs and even Word documents!\nThis is very handy when you are writing an analysis report you need to share with others.\n\n\nHow to run code\nThe first code chunk in an Rmd file is a special one: it’s called setup and it’s where you attach all the packages needed for running the code in the file. (You can find the name of a code chunk—or define one yourself!—in the first line of a code block: ```{r chunk-name}). The first code chunk of an Rmd file should always be named setup.\nThe setup code chunk also has special code from the knitr package. The knitr package is what allows you to run R code from Rmd files.\nThe line knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE) sets the option echo to TRUE. The echo option let’s you decide whether you want the R code printed (echoed) in the rendered Rmd file. When echo = TRUE the code is printed, when echo = FALSE the code is not printed.\nNow go ahead and add library(tidyverse) in the line next to the knitr::opts_chunk line.\nTo run the code of a code chunk you can use different approaches:\n\nClick on the green arrow to the right of the code chunk to run the entire code chunk.\nAlternatively, place the text cursor inside the code chunk and press CMD/CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER.\nYou can also run line by line as you do in an R script by placing the text cursor on the line you want to run and press CMD/CTRL + ENTER.\n\nNow delete everything after the setup code chunk and write a new level-2 heading after the chunk with the name “Plotting basics”. (Remember to leave an empty line between the chunk and the heading.)\n\nYou will use this Rmd file to write text and code for this tutorial. To insert a new code chunk, you can click on the Insert a new code chunk button and then select R, or you can press OPT/ALT + CMD/CTRL + I.\n\nA new R code chunk will be inserted at the text cursor position."

We have already attached the library(tidyverse) packages, among which there is ggplot2, so you don’t need to do anything else.\n\nThe polite data\nWe will use the polite data to learn the basics of plotting using ggplot.\nThe data comes from the paper by Winter and Grawunder, 2020. The phonetic profile of Korean formal and informal speech registers. DOI: 10.1016/j.wocn.2012.08.006\nTo download the file with the data right-click on the following link and download the file: polite.csv. (Note that tutorial files are also linked in the Syllabus). Remember to save the file in data/ in the course project folder.\nWith Rmd files, we can use relative paths to read data. For relative paths to work relative to the project working directory, you need to install the here package (remember how to install packages?) and add the following line in the setup chunk, just after the first line of code.\nknitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = here::here())\n(Note that it’s knitr::opts_knit rather than knitr::opts_chunk).\nNow rerun the setup code chunk to set the new option.\nThis will set the working directory for the Rmd file to the project working directory.\nMake sure that this line is always in the setup block, or R might get confused about where the working directory is and not be able to find the data.\nFinally, create a new code chunk, add the following line of code and then run the code chunk to read the data.\n\npolite <- read_csv(\"data/polite.csv\")\n\nIn this tutorial we will use the following columns:\n\nf0mn: mean f0 (fundamental frequency).\nH1H2: difference between H2 and H1 (second and first harmonic).\ngender: speaker’s gender.\nmusicstudent: whether the speaker is a music student (yes) or not (no).\n\n\n\nA basic plot\nThese are the minimum constituents of a ggplot2 plot.\n\nThe data: you have to specify the data frame with the data you want to plot.\nThe mapping: the mapping tells ggplot how to map data columns to parts of the plot like the axes or groupings within the data. These parts are called aesthetics, or aes for short.\n\nYou can specify the data and mapping with the data and mapping arguments of the ggplot() function.\nNote that the mapping argument is always specified with aes().\nIn the following bare plot, we are just mapping the mean f0 (f0) to the x-axis and the H2-H1 difference to the y-axis, from the polite data frame.\nCreate a new code chunk, copy the following code and run it. From this point on I will assume you’ll create a new code chunk and run the code yourself, without explicit instructions.\n\nggplot(\n  data = polite,\n  mapping = aes(x = f0mn, y = H1H2)\n)\n\n\n\n\nNot much to see here: just two axes!\n\n\nLet’s add geometries\nNice, but we are missing the most important part: showing the data!\nData is represented with geometries, or geoms for short. geoms are added to the base ggplot with functions whose names all start with geom_.\nFor this plot, you want to use geom_point(). This geom simply adds point to the plot based on the data in the polite data frame.\nTo add geoms to a plot, you write a + at the end of the ggplot() command and include the geom on the next line. For example:\n\nggplot(\n  data = polite,\n  mapping = aes(x = f0mn, y = H1H2)\n) +\n  geom_point()\n\nWarning: Removed 12 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\nThis type of plot, with two continuous axes and data represented by points, is called a scatter plot.\nNote that using the + is a quirk of ggplot(). The idea behind it is that you start from a bare plot and you add (+) layers of data on top of it. This is because of the philosophy behind the package, called the Layered Grammar of Graphics.\n\n\nFunction arguments\nNote that the data and mapping arguments don’t have to be named explicitly (with data = and mapping =) in the ggplot() function, since they are obligatory and they are specified in that order.\n\nggplot(\n  polite,\n  aes(x = f0mn, y = H1H2)\n) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, you can also leave out x = and y =.\n\nggplot(\n  polite,\n  aes(f0mn, H1H2)\n) +\n  geom_point()\n\nWarning: Removed 12 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\nTry running ?ggplot in the Console to see the arguments of the function and the order they appear in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nWhich of the following will produce the same plot as the one above? Reason through it first without running the code, then run all of these to check whether they look the way you expected.\n\nggplot(polite, aes(H1H2, f0mn)) + geom_point()\nggplot(polite, aes(y = H1H2, x = f0mn)) + geom_point()\nggplot(polite, aes(y = f0mn, x = H1H2)) + geom_point()"

In the following example, we will be counting the number of languages by their endangerment status.\n\nDo you understand me?\nThere are thousands of languages in the world, but most of them are losing speakers, and some are already no longer spoken. The endangerment status of a language in the data is on a scale from not endangered (languages with large populations of speakers) through threatened, shifting and nearly extinct, to extinct (languages that have no living speakers left).\nThe glot_status data frame contains the endangerment status for 7,845 languages from Glottolog. To download the file with the data right-click on the following link and download the file: glot_status.rds. (Note that tutorial files are also linked in the Syllabus). Remember to save the file in data/ in the course project folder.\nThis time the file is not a .csv file but an .rds file. .rds files are files that can save any R object. They are commonly used to save data frames, like in this case.\nTo read an .rds file you need the readRDS() function.\n\nglot_status <- readRDS(\"data/glot_status.rds\")\n\nHere’s what the data frame looks like.\n\nglot_status\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nFor us today, the most important columns are:\n\nName: the language name.\nstatus: the endangerment status of the language.\nMacroarea: the geographic macro-area the language is spoken in.\n\n\n\nCreate a bar chart\nTo create a bar chart, add geom_bar() to the plot.\nYou only need one axis, the x axis to be precise, because the y-axis will have the counts.\nAlso, note how we’re using %>% to pipe the glot_status data frame into the ggplot() function. This works because ggplot()’s first argument is the data, and piping is a different way of providing the first argument to a function.\n\nglot_status %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = status)) +\n  ...\n\nNote how the counting is done automatically. R looks in the status column and counts how many times each value in the column occurs in the data frame.\n\n\nStacked bar charts\nA special type of bar charts are the so-called stacked bar charts. These are bar charts where each bar contains a “stack” of shorter bars, each indicating the counts of some sub-groups.\nTo create a stacked bar chart, you just need to add a new aesthetic mapping: fill. The fill aesthetic lets you fill bars or areas with different colours depending on the values of a specified column.\nLet’s make a plot on language endangerment by macro-area.\nComplete the following code by specifying that fill should be based on status.\n\nggplot(\n  data = glot_status,\n  mapping = aes(x = Macroarea, ...)\n) +\n  geom_bar()"

But how do we get the values for this new column (without having to manually code each consonant as voiceless or voiced)?\nWe can use the ifelse() function!\nThe ifelse() function works a bit like the English sentence “If X is true, do Y, otherwise do Z”. The “X” has to be a “logical statement”, i.e. an expression using logical operators.\n\n\nLogical operators\n\n\nViolin plots\nAn efficient way of showing the distribution of continuous variables depending on discrete groups (like attitude) are the so-called violin plots.\nGo ahead and run the following code.\n\npolite %>%\n  ggplot(aes(attitude, f0mn)) +\n  geom_violin()\n\nThey are called violin plots because they look like violins!\n\n\nLay over the raw data\nYou can lay over raw data on top of the violins.\nTo do so, you can use the jitter geometry.

If you add the jitter geometry before the violin geometry, the violins will just cover up the jittered points (see why it is called “layered” grammar of graphics?).\n\n\nLet’s add some colour\nLet’s fill the violins with colour. For now, just colour the violins depending on attitude\n\npolite %>%\n  ggplot(aes(attitude, f0mn, ...)) +\n  geom_violin()\n\n\nfill = ...\n\nNot bad! But maybe we can improve by making the fill a bit transparent?\nYou can achieve that with the alpha argument in geom_violin(), which takes a number between 0 (completely transparent) and 1 (completely opaque).\nAdd it to the code above to make the fill transparent. Try different values until you are satisfied with the output.\n\n\nSeparate the data by gender\nIn the previous section we have filled the violins with colours depending on attitude. This helps making the plot somewhat more appealing, but colour there doesn’t add information to the plot: attitude is already marked by the x-axis, so filling by attitude is a bit redundant.\nInstead, we can use the fill argument to separate the data into further groups based on other variables in the data.\nGo ahead and separate the data by gender using the fill argument.\n\npolite %>%\n  ggplot(aes(attitude, f0mn, ...)) +\n  geom_violin()\n\nWhat if we want to move the colour legend to the bottom of the plot?\n\nIn ggplot2, we control the position of the legend by modifying an elements of the theme option.

Eventually you’ll memorise quirky ggplot2 features like this, and until then, you can figure it out by searching “How do I change legend position in ggplot” and some kind soul on the internet will tell you.)\nCheck out the documentation of theme by typing ?theme in the RStudio Console and press ENTER. Search for the word position.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nWhich of the following moves the legend to the bottom of the plot?\n\nlegend(\"bottom\")\ntheme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\ntheme(legend.bottom)\n\n\n\nTo check, try replacing the first ... in the code below with the y = specification you used above, and the second ... with the correct way of moving the legend to the bottom of the plot. Run the code to see if you’re right!\n\nggplot(\n  data = glot_status,\n  mapping = aes(x = Macroarea, ...)\n) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  ..."

(Again, we are doing this now for pedagogical reasons, not because this is what you would do with this data in real-life research).\n\nThe filter() function\nFiltering in R with the tidyverse is straightforward. You can use the filter() function.\nIn the code below, we are filtering the alb_vot data so that we only include the voiceless stops c(\"p\", \"t\", \"k\"). Moreover, we want only rows for with the VOT is less than 20 ms.\n\nalb_vot_vl <- alb_vot %>%\n  filter(\n    label %in% c(\"p\", \"t\", \"k\"),\n    vot < 20\n  )\n\nThis should not look to alien! The first statement, label %in% c(\"p\", \"t\", \"k\") works like the %in% statement we used above with mutate().\nIn filter(), you can add multiple statements to filter the data with, separated by commas. Here we have a second statement, vot < 20, i.e. “give me VOT values that are less than 20 ms.\nYou might have noticed that we need to assign the output of filter(), which is a data frame, to a new variable alb_vot_vl. This will be the data frame you will use in the next section."

    "text": "If-else\nWhat if we want to plot the density of voiceless and voiced consonants separately?\nWe could use faceting, as you learnt in Week 3, or we can use the aesthetics fill and/or colour.\nHowever, first we need to create a new column that indicated if a consonant is voiceless or voiced!\nWe will use the mutate() function again to create a new voicing column. But how do we get the values for this new column (without having to manually code each consonant as voiceless or voiced)?\nWe can use the ifelse() function!\nThe ifelse() function works a bit like the English sentence “If X is true, do Y, otherwise do Z”. The “X” has to be a “logical statement”, i.e. an expression using logical operators. So let’s talk about logical operators (we will get back to them below, when we will filter the VOT data).\n\nLogical operators\nThere are four main logical operators:\n\nx == y: x equals y.\nx != y: x is not equal to y.\nx > y: x is greater than y.\nx < y: x is smaller than y.\n\nLogical operators return TRUE or FALSE depending on whether the statement they convey is true or false. Remember, TRUE and FALSE are logical values.\nTry these out in the Console:\n\n# This will return FALSE\n1 == 2\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n# FALSE\n\"apples\" == \"oranges\"\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n# TRUE\n10 > 5\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n# FALSE\n10 > 15\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n# TRUE\n3 < 4\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n\n\nFinding unique values\nLet’s create a new column that states whether a consonant is voiced or voiceless.\nSo, the data contains the following consonants:\n\ncons_ipa <- alb_vot$consonant\n\nunique(cons_ipa)\n\n [1] \"ts\" \"b\"  \"ɡ\"  \"k\"  \"p\"  \"t\"  \"d\"  \"dz\" \"tʃ\" \"d̻ʒ̻\" \"t̻ʃ̻\" \"dʒ\"\n\n\nWait, what’s that $ in alb_vot$consonant there? That is a base R way of extracting a single column (in this case consonant) from a data frame (alb_vot).\nIf you check cons_ipa in the Environment tab, it will say that this is chr vector, i.e. a character vector. This makes sense, because consonant is a character column in alb_vot.\nThe unique() function shows the unique values of a vector (it works with any type of vector, numeric, character, logical, …).\nThis is great, we now know all the consonants in the consonant column, but maybe it will be easier to type them later if we use the custom transcription in label rather than IPA.\n\ncons_lab <- alb_vot$label\n\nunique(cons_lab)\n\n [1] \"ts\" \"b\"  \"g\"  \"k\"  \"p\"  \"t\"  \"d\"  \"dz\" \"tS\" \"J\"  \"c\"  \"dZ\"\n\n\nGreat! Now, to make things easier, let me tell you which consonants are voiceless and which are voiced:\n\nvoiceless: c(\"ts\", \"k\", \"p\", \"t\", \"tS\", \"c\").\nvoiced: c(\"b\", \"g\", \"d\", \"dz\", \"J\", \"dZ\").\n\n\n\nThe %in% operator\nNow with this knowledge we can create a new column with voiceless and voiced values for each row in the data frame. Like so:\n\nalb_vot <- alb_vot %>%\n  mutate(\n    voicing = ifelse(\n      # IF this is TRUE\n      label %in% c(\"ts\", \"k\", \"p\", \"t\", \"tS\", \"c\"),\n      # Write\n      \"voiceless\",\n      # OR ELSE write\n      \"voiced\"\n    )\n  )\n\nLet’s unpack this. First of all, what is label %in% c(\"ts\", \"k\", \"p\", \"t\", \"tS\", \"c\") doing?\nThe %in% operator is a special logical operator that returns TRUE if the value to the left is one of the values in the list to its right, and FALSE if not.\nTry these in the Console:\n\n# TRUE\n5 %in% c(1, 2, 5, 7)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n# FALSE\n\"apples\" %in% c(\"oranges\", \"banana\")\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\nBut %in% is even more powerful because the value on the left does not have to be a single value, but it can also be a vector! We say %in% is vectorised because it can work with vectors (most functions and operators in R are vectorised).\n\n# TRUE, TRUE\nc(1, 5) %in% c(4, 1, 7, 5, 8)\n\n[1] TRUE TRUE\n\nstocked <- c(\"durian\", \"bananas\", \"grapes\")\nneeded <- c(\"durian\", \"apples\")\n\n# TRUE, FALSE\nneeded %in% stocked\n\n[1]  TRUE FALSE\n\n\nTry to understand what is going on in the code above before moving on.\n\n\nVoiceless or voiced?\nSo now run the code to create a new column voicing.\n\nalb_vot <- alb_vot %>%\n  mutate(\n    voicing = ifelse(\n      # IF this is TRUE\n      label %in% c(\"ts\", \"k\", \"p\", \"t\", \"tS\", \"c\"),\n      # Write\n      \"voiceless\",\n      # OR ELSE write\n      \"voiced\"\n    )\n  )\n\nThe ifelse function is doing the following:\n\nIf the value in the column label is among (%in%) the values in the vector c(\"ts\", \"k\", \"p\", \"t\", \"tS\", \"c\").\nWrite voiceless in the voicing column.\nOtherwise write voiced.\n\nCheck out the voicing column in alb_vot.\nNow that we have the info we need to plot voiceless and voiced consonants separately, let’s do that! But to spice things up a bit, let’s do it with violin plots."

Try different values until you are satisfied with the output. You could also add alpha to geom_jitter() to make the points a bit transparent.\n\nalb_vot %>%\n  ggplot(aes(voicing, vot, fill = voicing)) +\n  geom_violin(...) +\n  geom_jitter(width = 0.05)\n\nWonderful!
